## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- BEM Naming Convention

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to implement the BEM naming convention. If there were more cards on the page, I could implement a modifier. For instance, if I wanted to add a modifier to a card to indicate a featured card, I could do something like:

```html
<main class="card card--featured">
</main>
```
```css
.card--featured {
  border: 2px solid var(--clr-darkblue);
}
```

### Continued development

I'll continue using BEM methodology for larger projects while exploring advanced CSS and JavaScript for more challenging, interactive future work.
